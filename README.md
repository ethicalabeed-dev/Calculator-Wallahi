This is a very basic calculator program written in C that allows users to perform simple arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program prompts the user to choose an operation and enter two numbers, then it calculates and displays the result based on the selected operation.

Features:

	•	User-Friendly Interface: The program welcomes users and provides clear instructions for selecting an operation and entering numbers.
	•	Operations Supported:
	•	Addition: Sums two numbers.
	•	Subtraction: Finds the difference between two numbers.
	•	Multiplication: Multiplies two numbers.
	•	Division: Divides one number by another, with a check to avoid division by zero.
	•	Input Validation: The program checks if the user selects a valid operation (1 to 4) and handles errors gracefully, providing feedback if the input is invalid.
	•	Output Format: Results are displayed with two decimal places for clarity.

	1.	Run the program.
	2.	Select an operation by entering the corresponding number (1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, etc.).
